# TestEase ‚Äì UI Testing Practice Platform

Welcome to **TestEase**, a sandbox web application created for **QA trainees and automation engineers** to practice testing workflows using real UI components.

---

## üéØ Project Purpose

The goal of this platform is to simulate a real-world web application containing the most commonly used UI elements. It is built specifically for manual testers and automation engineers to practice:

- Writing test cases
- Identifying DOM elements
- Automating common user interactions
- Validating UI behaviors and field validations

---

## üë• Who Can Use This?

- QA trainees practicing Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium
- Manual testers learning inspection and validation
- Trainers and mentors conducting hands-on sessions
- Students in software testing bootcamps or courses

---

## üß© Key Components Available for Testing

| Component       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Login Page**      | Inputs for email/password, error validation, form submission |
| **Register Page**   | Inputs for user data, validations, duplicate checks |
| **Forms & Fields**  | Dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, text inputs |
| **Modals/Popups**   | Trigger-based modals for visibility and focus testing |
| **Data Tables**     | Search, sort, and pagination-ready tables |
| **Alerts & Toasts** | Real-time UI feedback for success and error scenarios |

---

## üîç Testing Scenarios Supported

- Element selection and interaction
- Input validation and error handling
- Conditional rendering and UI visibility
- Alert/modal testing
- Page navigation and route guarding

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React if applicable)
- **Backend**: Optional/mock APIs (Node.js or Express)
